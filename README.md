# web-scraper-public
repo to host my [redacted] web scrapers.  i wanted to download an entire comic series.

first method uses the site's api and json, and the second scraped the html

note: do not run this as-is!  it is just to illustrate!

for scrape_json_api:
* does NOT make the filenames nice
* does NOT check if it downloads correctly
